	<h2>Pantheon Live</h2>
	<p>The game is an Unreal 4 prototype made as a pitch for a project at NAD with 4 teammates.
	</p>
	
	<h3>About:</h3>
	<p>Pantheon Live is a third-person multiplayer game set in an anachronic Egyptian universe where Gods are holding a competition on TV to find the next God superstar. The challengers fight on giant balls and need to push each other off their balls to score points and win the trust of Anubis.
	</p>
	
	<h3>My tasks:</h3>
	<p>Game design, world building, gameplay scripting, some of the character design, character modeling
	</p>

	<p>The concept came from the movement system at first. The idea of players rolling balls in a skate-inspired arena felt interesting and refreshing. Trying to tie this with various kinds of gameplay I figured it would be good to match it with third-person shooter mechanics. Multiplayer shooters often have the problem of sudden deaths and campers. Tying the movement system to the goal of the game by having to knock opponents off of their ball meant two things: <br />
	- If you want to score you need to go upclose to claim your point.<br />
	- You always have to kill players in 2 steps, preventing sudden deaths from being a problem.

	<p><b>[On the left]</b> A drawing depicting the feeling of mayhem of a match. Weapons should be in areas that reward speed. The players are cheered on by the crowd and commentated by Anubis (God of death, in charge of respawning the players, acts pretentious about it) and Bastet (God of joy and festivities, cheers for the winner and often argues with Anubis).<br />
	<b>[On the right]</b> Game loop of a player's life in Pantheon Live. Rather than being encouraged to keep a distance, players are more effective if they try to build momentum while looking for enemies. That way, if they find an enemy who is already unstable, they can easily dash into them and secure the kill. On the other side, if you're unstable, there is a chance of escape if you were already going faster than them, allowing you to recover while the enemy is catching up.
