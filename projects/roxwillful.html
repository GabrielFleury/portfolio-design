	<h2>The Unfortunate Adventures of Rox Willful</h2>
	<p>This is an Unreal 4 game made with a team of 10. It started as our final project at NAD and is being wrapped up in our spare time.<br />
	It got <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=681309671" target="_blank">Greenlit on Steam</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h3>About:</h3>
	<p>Rox Willful is a sci-fi point-and-click game exploring post-war themes with quirky humor. The player has to resolve conflicts through dialogue, object trading and minigames.
	</p>
	
	<h3>My tasks:</h3>
	<p>Game design, helping the writer tell the story through gameplay, gameplay scripting on minigames, character modeling, trailer
	</p>

	<p>The idea came when getting together to pick a final project. Our team had nobody specializing in either environment art or level design, but we had an illustrator and multiple character artists. I came up with the idea of a point&click game blending 2D and 3D, and had to make sure the entire game was possible to create with our resources without relying on models outside of characters.

	<h3>The writing</h3>
	<p>
	We have an award winning writer on our team, but while he loves video games, his only experience in professional writing is from movies and television. I had regular meetings with him so we could come up with a story that made sense to play, with dialogue choices and some non-linearity. Below is the format I ended up making to keep everything organized. It is a flowchart containing all the possibilities of dialogue and interaction. Black arrows represent mandatory steps to progress, while grey arrows represent optional dialogue. The writer then wrote the full dialogue in a separate document for each possibility using the coordinates. Those coordinates are also used in a data table in-game to make it easier to update.

	<h3>The minigames</h3>
	<p>
	I was in charge of coming up with minigames to spice up the gameplay between dialogue sections. They had to fit the theme and not be too difficult since they are mandatory. I designed and coded 3 minigames:<br />
	-Tear apart a toaster/radio hybrid to get a specific piece.<br />
	-Pinball machine where the ball itself is the object you need to retreive.<br />
	-Pipe machine where you have to purify a dirty liquid.<br />
	</p>
